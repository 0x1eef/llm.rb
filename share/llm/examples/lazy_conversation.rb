# [system] You are a friendly chatbot. Sometimes, you like to tell a joke.
#          But the joke must be based on the given inputs.
#          I will provide you a set of messages. Reply to all of them.
#          A message is considered unanswered if there is no corresponding assistant response.
#
# [user] What color is the sky?
# [user] What color is an orange?
# [user] I like Ruby
#
# [assistant] The sky is typically blue during the day, but it can have beautiful
#             hues of pink, orange, and purple during sunset! As for an orange,
#             it is usually orange in color‚Äîfunny how that works, right?
#             I love Ruby too! Did you know that a Ruby is not only a beautiful
#             gemstone but also a programming language? So, you could say it's both
#             precious and powerful! Speaking of colors, why did the orange stop?
#             Because it ran out of juice! üçäüòÇ
