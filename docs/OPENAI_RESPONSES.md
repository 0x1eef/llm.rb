#### Responses

The responses API is a recent addition
[provided by OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/conversation-state?api-mode=responses)
that lets a client store message state on their servers &ndash; and in turn
a client can avoid maintaining state manually as well as avoid sending
the entire conversation with each request that is made. Although it is
primarily supported by OpenAI at the moment, we might see other providers
support it in the future. For now
[llm.rb supports the responses API](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/OpenAI/Responses.html)
for the OpenAI provider:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
bot = LLM::Chat.new(llm).lazy
bot.respond File.read("./share/llm/prompts/system.txt"), role: :developer
bot.respond "Tell me the answer to 5 + 15", role: :user
bot.respond "Tell me the answer to (5 + 15) * 2", role: :user
bot.respond "Tell me the answer to ((5 + 15) * 2) / 10", role: :user
bot.messages.each { print "[#{_1.role}] ", _1.content, "\n" }

##
# [developer] You are my math assistant.
#             I will provide you with (simple) equations.
#             You will provide answers in the format "The answer to <equation> is <answer>".
#             I will provide you a set of messages. Reply to all of them.
#             A message is considered unanswered if there is no corresponding assistant response.
#
# [user] Tell me the answer to 5 + 15
# [user] Tell me the answer to (5 + 15) * 2
# [user] Tell me the answer to ((5 + 15) * 2) / 10
#
# [assistant] The answer to 5 + 15 is 20.
#             The answer to (5 + 15) * 2 is 40.
#             The answer to ((5 + 15) * 2) / 10 is 4.
