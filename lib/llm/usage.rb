# The {LLM::Usage LLM::Usage} class represents token usage for
# a given conversation or completion. As a conversation grows,
# so does the number of tokens used. This class helps track
# the number of input, output, reasoning and overall token count.
# It can also help track usage of the context window (which may
# vary by model).
