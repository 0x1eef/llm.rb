Although the country had some of the world\u2019s highest rates of mother-to-child HIV transmission in the early 2000s, today that rate has dropped to **under 1%**, equating to **fewer than 100 HIV-positive infants born each year**. This remarkable transformation is credited to dedicated political commitment, investments in scientific infrastructure, and extensive public health education.([goodgoodgood.co](https://www.goodgoodgood.co/articles/good-news-this-week-august-30-2025?utm_source=openai))\n\nMoreover, Botswana has become the **first high-burden country** to earn **World Health Organization Gold Tier status** for eliminating mother-to-child HIV transmission as a public health threat\u2014a testament to its extraordinary public health achievement.([goodgoodgood.co](https://www.goodgoodgood.co/articles/good-news-this-week-august-30-2025?utm_source=openai))\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n- It represents a **dramatic reversal** of an urgent health crisis, with mother-to-child HIV transmission rates falling from a staggering **20\u201340%** to under 1% over just two decades.\n- Botswana\u2019s success offers a **blueprint for other countries** facing similar challenges, showing what sustained investment and political will can achieve.\n- The WHO recognition not only honors Botswana's efforts but also sets a **global standard** for public health targets.\n\nThis story demonstrates the life-changing power of sustained, focused efforts in public health. Let me know if you\u2019d like to explore more positive stories from today or this week!"
