                  "text": "Here are two truly uplifting stories from **today, Sunday, February 22, 2026**, reflecting creativity, community, and empowerment:\n\n1. **Tropfest Returns to Sydney: A Celebration of Emerging Filmmakers**  \n   After six transformative years, **Tropfest**, the world\u2019s largest short film festival, has made a triumphant return today in **Centennial Park, Sydney**. The event features 16 finalist films premiering under the stars, with a live global livestream for audiences everywhere. Entry is free (with required registration), and a prize fund of **$100,000** is at stake to support emerging talents\u2014$50,000 for first prize, $30,000 for second, and $20,000 for third ([dailytelegraph.com.au](https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/wentworth-courier/2026-tropfest-finalists-celebrate-return-of-iconic-short-film-festival-at-centennial-park/news-story/727df57b2cb18f78effef455215d2d3c?utm_source=openai)).\n\n   The festival has undergone a thoughtful transformation, now operated by the **not-for-profit Tropfest Foundation**, under the leadership of chair Sarah Murdoch and a board including Peter V\u2019landys and Bryan Brown. This new structure ensures sustainability and community engagement ([theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2026/feb/14/john-polson-and-david-michod-on-tropfests-return-the-film-festival-that-can-change-your-career-overnight?utm_source=openai)).\n\n   Among notable developments, a dynamic and star-studded jury\u2014headed by **Margot Robbie**, with **Sarah Snook**, Bruna Papandrea, and Dylan River\u2014brings exciting visibility and credibility to the event. The significance of Tropfest lies in its reputation as a launch pad for filmmakers\u2014past alumni include Nash Edgerton, Rebel Wilson, Murray Bartlett, David Mich\u00f4d, and others ([dailytelegraph.com.au](https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/emmy-winner-sarah-snook-joins-margot-robbie-on-starstudded-tropfest-jury/news-story/5af293ed87dcfc422d2f53df3db61e1c?utm_source=openai)).\n\n   This return marks a powerful moment in creative storytelling\u2014uniting communities, empowering new voices, and celebrating filmmaking with renewed energy and inclusivity.\n\n2. **Boosting News Literacy in Colorado**  \n   In Ridgway, Colorado, a free community event titled *\u201cRecognizing Credible News in a Time of Truth Decay\u201d* is taking place today from **4\u20136 pm** at Space to Create. Led by Emmy-award-winning journalists **Judy Muller** and **George Lewis**, this workshop aims to equip attendees with tools to discern factual news from misinformation\u2014vital skills in our media-saturated age. Free childcare is also available for registrants ([nationaltoday.com](https://nationaltoday.com/us/co/ouray/news/2026/02/12/improve-your-news-literacy-at-free-event-on-feb-22?utm_source=openai)).\n\n   As the News Literacy Project explains, in an environment overflowing with blogs, deepfakes, viral rumors, and manipulated content, being able to evaluate sources critically is more vital than ever ([nationaltoday.com](https://nationaltoday.com/us/co/ouray/news/2026/02/12/improve-your-news-literacy-at-free-event-on-feb-22?utm_source=openai)).\n\n---\n\n**Why these stories matter:**\n\n- **Tropfest\u2019s revival** showcases the beauty of storytelling and resilience\u2014creators, filmmakers, and audiences alike are welcomed into a communal space where culture flourishes freely.\n- **The news literacy workshop** contributes to a smarter, more informed public\u2014empowering individuals to navigate today's complex information environment with clarity and skepticism.\n\nIn sum, today\u2019s standout positive stories highlight both creative expression and civic education\u2014two pillars that strengthen our communities.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more details or additional uplifting news from today!"
