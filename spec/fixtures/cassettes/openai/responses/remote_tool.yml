In response to heightened enforcement actions by ICE, Iglesia Dios Habla Hoy organized a large-scale effort to deliver aid to those in need. Since mid\u2011December, the church has mobilized hundreds of volunteers and distributed **12,000 grocery boxes** to families in need; as of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, **24,000 households** had registered for assistance.\u202f([goodgoodgood.co](https://www.goodgoodgood.co/articles/good-news-this-week-january-24-2026?utm_source=openai))\n\nWhy this is significant:\n- It demonstrates how local communities, driven by compassion and solidarity, can respond powerfully to hardship.\u202f([goodgoodgood.co](https://www.goodgoodgood.co/articles/good-news-this-week-january-24-2026?utm_source=openai))\n- The initiative is inspired by the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr., who preached \"love as a moral imperative.\" The effort is both practical and deeply rooted in a message of hope and unity.\u202f([goodgoodgood.co](https://www.goodgoodgood.co/articles/good-news-this-week-january-24-2026?utm_source=openai))\n\nThis story stands out today as a genuine example of how neighbors can come together in challenging times to create meaningful, positive change."
