        let''s see. The user wants three answers to three math questions, each on

        3 plus 2 equals 5. So the answer is 5.\n\nSecond question: 5 + 5. That''s
        10. Simple addition, no complications there.\n\nThird question: 5 + 7. Hmm,
        5 plus 7 is 12. I need to make sure I didn''t mix up the numbers. Yeah, 5+7
        is definitely 12. \n\nWait, the user said to keep answers short and concise,
        one number per line. Let me double-check each answer. 3+2 is 5, correct. 5+5
        is 10, right. 5+7 is 12. Yep, that''s all. No need for extra text, just the
