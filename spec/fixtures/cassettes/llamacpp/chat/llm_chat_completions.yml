        let me tackle these math problems. The user wants three answers, each on a
        separate line, just numbers.\n\nFirst question: 3 + 2. That''s straightforward.
        3 plus 2 equals 5. So the answer is 5.\n\nSecond question: 5 + 5. Hmm, 5 plus
        5 is 10. I need to make sure there''s no trick here, but it''s just basic
        addition. So 10.\n\nThird question: 5 + 7. Let me check that again. 5 plus
        7... 5+7 is 12. Yep, that''s right. So the answers should be 5, 10, 12. I
        need to make sure each answer is on its own line and only the numbers are
