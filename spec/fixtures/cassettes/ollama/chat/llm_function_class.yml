        the user asked me to run the ''date'' command. Let me check the tools available.
        There''s a system function that takes a command parameter. So I need to call
        that function with ''date'' as the argument. I''ll structure the tool call
        correctly in JSON inside the XML tags. Once the response comes back, I''ll
        display the output to the user. Since the response was successful, I''ll just
        show the date result without any extra text.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\nCurrent
