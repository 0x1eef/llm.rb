        let''s see. The user wants three answers, each on a separate line, and they
        should be numbers only. The questions are straightforward arithmetic problems.\n\nFirst
        question: 3 + 2. That''s simple. 3 plus 2 equals 5. No problem there.\n\nSecond
        question: 5 + 5. That''s 10. Easy enough.\n\nThird question: 5 + 7. Hmm, 5
        plus 7 is 12. Wait, is that right? Let me check again. Yeah, 5 + 7 is definitely
        12. Okay, that''s correct.\n\nI need to make sure each answer is just the
        number, no extra text. So the answers should be:\n\n5\n\n10\n\n12\n\nThat''s
        all. No explanations, just the numbers.
