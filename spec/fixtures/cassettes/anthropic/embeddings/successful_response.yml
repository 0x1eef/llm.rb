      - You have not yet added your payment method in the billing page and will have
        reduced rate limits of 3 RPM and 10K TPM. To unlock our standard rate limits,
        please add a payment method in the billing page for the appropriate organization
        in the user dashboard (https://dashboard.voyageai.com/). Even with payment
        methods entered, the free tokens (200M tokens for Voyage series 3) will still
        apply. After adding a payment method, you should see your rate limits increase
        after several minutes. See our pricing docs (https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/pricing)
        for the free tokens for your model.
